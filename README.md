# Motion Detector 

## Gist:
* The purpose of this open source personal project is to get a gist of how OpenCV works and manifests itself to create various Computer Vision applications.
* This python script will allow you to detect motion in front of the camera that you are using while storing the time interval of the motion.
_Language_ : Python
_Libraries used_ : Numpy, OpenCV

## Upshot :
Videos, essentially, can be stored as a stack of image frames. The Tarantino movies that you so take pleasure in watching are, in their essence, a large amount of pictures shown in rapid enough succession. *Fun Fact* - A human brain needs atleast 24 frames per second to perceive a series of image frames as a video. Here, I am trying to compare different frames in the succession to the initial static frame. This is done by comparing the intensity values of the pixels. That is exactly what I have tried here to do.
